	<h1>about jessica</h1>
	
	<p>Jessica is a mixed bag of culture. Raised by Taiwanese parents in the Hong Kong society largely filled with American influences, this upbringing has caused a confused child who does not know where to pinpoint as home. </p>
	<p>This confused child, having learnt three languages in her childhood, would go on to love all languages - including those spoken for front-end web development! Although she had always been interested in tinkering with web pages, it was not until 2015 that she finally decided to cement the language of the web once and for all. </p>
	<p class="small">(She also has an intense love for puppies, hence the photo of her absolutely adorable puppy, Raja.)</p>
