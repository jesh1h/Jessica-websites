	<h1>my portfolio</h1>
	<p>Albeit a budding front-end web developer, Jessica has begun building a portfolio to showcase all her learnings. Here are some of her current projects:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a class="relaxr" href="#">Relaxr</a> A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, wanted Jessica to develop a new landing page for their company. She built the site from their design and assets.</li>
		<li><a href="#">CitiPix</a> A new startup - CitiPix -  was looking to create a personalized picture app that allows users to store pictures they've taken around the world and quickly access them by typing in keywords or tags associated with each photo. They asked Jessica to build the front-end prototype.</li>
